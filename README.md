### Game Description
“Labyrinth” is a game of pathfinding inspired by the mobile game [Amaze](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crazylabs.amaze.game&hl=en). The game’s objective is to cover all the available spaces by moving the character “Laby” within a certain move limitation. There will be multiple levels to beat each with different maps and move limitations. On every level, items will pop up in random positions which can help to complete each level. 
### Game Rules
- Players can only choose from 4 moves, which are left, right, up, or down. “Laby” will move to the respective direction until it hits an obstruction or end of the map. 
- Spaces traveled by Laby will be counted towards the travel count regardless if Laby has already covered the place before or not.
- If “Laby” exceeds the travel limitation, the player loses.
- An item will be placed randomly on the map to reduce Laby’s travel count. The number of reduced travel count varies among the maps.
